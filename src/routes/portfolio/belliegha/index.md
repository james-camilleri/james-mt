description: branding and performance media design for large-scale theatrical production
---

Another piece of work for Arthaus (previously DLS Productions), Belliegħa was a large-scale original musical production performed in an outdoor theatre in Valletta. I handled the branding and graphic design for all the marketing and production materials, as well as the media design and production for all the backdrops that would be displayed on the set's enormous 14m LED-screen array during the production.

The logotype was calligraphic in nature, inspired by blackletter-style lettering. After hand-writing the initial drafts (an excellent excuse to use my new calligraphy pens), the wording was digitised and ornamented. (The "belliegħa" is a mythical Maltese creature said to live in wells and lure unwitting children to a watery death, which inspired the tendril-like designs on the logotype.) The marketing materials were printed with a three-colour process with metallic inks, which added a slightly ethereal feel to the material.

The performance backdrops were animated in After Effects, and designed to be played alongside live music. During the performance, I used Resolume Arena to map the videos across the screen array and cue them to their appropriate songs – a different experience to being on stage like I'm used to, but no less stressful/exhilarating.
