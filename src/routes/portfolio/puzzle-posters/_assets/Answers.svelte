While this looks like a simple repeating pattern at first, it's actually a little more complex than that. The black dots are actually abstracted representations of braille letters, when decoded spell out EEFGG FEDCC DEEDF EEFGG FEDCC – the opening notes to Beethoven's Ode to Joy. Completing the melody reveals the final 5 pattern components.

POSTER 2:
The mechanics of this puzzle are a little simpler than the previous, but a lot more legwork is required to get to the final answer. The grid of letters coupled with the coordinates in the blank spaces below can be used to formulate a set of Roman numerals, which when converted to standard digits read 35.895989,14.510712 – the coordinates of a plaque in the city of Valletta, Malta. For the second part of the puzzle, the coordinates pinpoint words on the plaque that are used to fill the crossword-like construction and form the central character sequence. Finally, the (3, 2, 6) → (12, 1, 7) coordinates points to two individual letters on the plaque which are used as the key for a Caeser cipher. When decoding the previously obtainer character sequence with the Caeser substitution, the phrase "CARPEDIEM" is revealed.
